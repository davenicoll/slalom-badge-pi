# slalom-badge-pi

A project to create a pi-based badge that slalom folk can wear and enjoy.

### Building an image

You'll need some disk space. Probably about 25GB.

Then...
```bash
make install # install dependencies
make image # create an image that can be flashed to a pi
```

```bash
make clean # if you'd like some disk space back :)
```
